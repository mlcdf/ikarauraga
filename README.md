## Ikarauraga

My friend Clément Stéphano and I made a ripoff of Ikaruga for the Ludum Dare 35. Initialy, we had a better idea in mind, unfortunately, without a graphic designer, we had to give it up.

Almost all the graphic assets (We only operate some color changes) are the work of Luis Zuno ([@ansimuz](https://twitter.com/ansimuz)). So huge thanks to him!
You can find them [here](http://ansimuz.com/site/archives/794) under the CC0 License.

We thought we sould do the same for the assets (scripts, sounds, etc...) we made. So, we're giving them away under the CC0 License too! Feel free to grab them for your next project!

The binaries for Linux/Windows are available [here](http://ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-35/?action=preview&uid=87871).
